# Serialization

- **Definition**: Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily stored (such as in a file or a database) or transmitted (such as across a network connection) and reconstructed later.

- **Purpose/Usage**:
    - **Storage**: Serialized data can be stored persistently on disk or in a database.
    - **Transmission**: Serialized data can be transmitted over a network efficiently.
    - **Interoperability**: Serialization enables different systems written in different languages or running on different platforms to exchange data.

- **Formats**: Common formats for serialized data include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and binary formats like Protocol Buffers or MessagePack.

# Deserialization

- **Definition**: Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization. It involves reconstructing an object or data structure from a serialized format back into an in-memory object or data structure.

- **Purpose/Usage**:
    - **Data Retrieval**: Deserialization retrieves data from storage or network transmission and converts it into usable objects or data structures.
    - **Interoperability**: It enables systems to read and understand data exchanged with other systems, regardless of the technology stack used.

### Why Serialization and Deserialization are Used

- **Efficiency**: Serialized data is typically more compact than the original object representation, making it efficient for storage and transmission.
- **Interoperability**: Allows communication between different platforms and languages.
- **Persistence**: Facilitates storing complex objects or data structures persistently.
- **State Transfer**: Enables distributed systems to exchange and synchronize state information.

### Example Scenario

- **Scenario**: Consider a web application that needs to save user preferences. When a user updates their preferences, the application serializes the updated preference object into JSON and stores it in a database. When the user logs in again, the application retrieves the JSON data from the database and deserializes it back into an object, restoring the user's preferences.
